# Welcome to the Kanawha Trace Trail Guide

The Kanawha Trace Trail (also called The KT Trail) is an approximately 32-mile trail that runs from Barboursville to Frasiers Bottom WV.  The Kanawha Trace Trail guide is a web-based application that allows users of the KT Trail to plan routes, record dates and times of routes they have completed, and submit maintenance requests.  The purpose of this application is to provide current and updated information about the status of the trail, and allow users to plan and navigate with tools that are easier to understand than paper-based topographical maps.  A secondary purpose is to improve the visibility of the trail and encourage new and existing users to venture out more often.

The target users are trail runners, hikers, mountain-bikers and backpackers who are interested in learning more about the features and technical aspects the KT trail.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
